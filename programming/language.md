# Coding Language in Unity

C# or [visual scripting](https://unity.com/features/unity-visual-scripting).

Unity also supports others like lua, even python (in Unity 6). But C# is nonetheless the go-to option. (I never use visual scripting so don't ask me anything about it)

It also supports C++. It is worth mentioning since Unity itself is actually written in C++. Therefore, the parallel between C# and C++ workflow creates some issue in GC. (But you don't have to worry about it for the majority of time)
