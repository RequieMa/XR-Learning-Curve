# ARKit
Apple provides a series of [dev tools](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/) to enable AR dev. 
- ARKit SDK
- RealityKit - An app which you can directly create AR experience
- USDZ file - A special 3D data compression method

With them, you can develop AR experience on Xcode with Swift (A programming language), and run on iOS device (only!)

**Simply don't use them!**

# ARCore
Similarly, Google provides [ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar). 

Then you can develop AR experience on Android Studio with either Java, or C++ and NDK. [Details](https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-android-sdk). 

Unlike ARKit, with ARCore, your app can run not only on Android devices, but also [iOS devices](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/ios/session-config). (**What is the point?**)

**Again don't use them!**
