## Core Mechanics

`List the core features of your game as bullet points`

- `____`
- `____`
- `____`

## Gameplay

`An example of a gameplay scenario and how it would play out. This should allow you and team member to imagine the gameplay and get inspired`

## Music

`How music and sound will be used in the game, and what feeling you want to get from the player. Name a couple of songs in a similar style`

## Art Style

`Describe the art style you'll use. Put reference images and the game names in case someone wants to research them`

## About

`More detail. A macro design should be less than 3 pages. Focus on the really important features`

## Scope Check

### Part 1: Visualization and Implementation

#### Visualization

Imagine that you are playing the game, choosing a specific goal

Questions:

1. What is on the screen?
2. What is moving or changing?
3. Are there visual effects?
4. Are there sound effects?
5. What the player is doing?
6. What happens in response to player's actions?
7. How do you tell the game what you want to do? (Interaction)
8. How does the game tell you you're making progress or not? (UI)

#### Implementation

1. How would you write the code for each thing in your previous lists?
   1. Have you done anything like it before?
   2. Is there code from previous projects that you can copy and adapt?
   3. Do you know of a tutorial or asset pack that could take care of some of the functionality for you?
   4. Do you have friends who can help you with these tasks?
2. What are the 3 biggest coding questions?
3. Browse for answers for your questions
4. Do you need to make any assets?
5. Do you need to find any assets online?

### Part 2: Scale, Challenges and Resources

#### Scale

Now think about the whole game. Think about all the parts of the game that can be numbered and grouped.

1. Make a list, put down a number for each that seems reasonable
2. Mentally cut each number in half
   1. Is the game still playable?
   2. Does it still create your core experience?
   3. Now try to reduce each one and ask the same question

#### Challenges

Write down the top 3 challenges you foresee in the process of making the game. Be specific, and phrase them as questions

#### Resources

1. The most important resource is your own time, so look at your calendar, write down the smallest number of hours that you can safely commit to
2. Now subtract 25% of the number for each week (things can happen)
3. Find three specific tutorials that will help you make your game

### Part 3: Reality Check

Look at your challenges and resources. Do you feel confident that you can make a fun game based on this concept by the end of development?

If so, explain why.

If not, rethink the game. (Save your first idea for the future!)
