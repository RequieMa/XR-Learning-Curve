# Game Development Pipeline

- Every game starts with a **concept**
- **Prototype** your game
  - test different parts of your idea
  - check whether they are fun
  - check whether you can pull them off
- **Play-test** your game
  - observe your players
  - refine the design
- **Release** a small but finished game

## An 8-week Plan

1. Week 1: The Design Process + Concept Document
   1. Fill Concept Document
   2. Get Peer Review
2. Week 2: Prototyping + Digital Prototype
   1. Make an Asset Inventory
   2. Prototype the game
3. Week 3: Milestones
   1. Backlog
   2. Class-Responsibility-Collaboration (CRC) Cards
   3. Build Vertical Slice
      1. Identify the core of your game
      2. Make a list of the features and assets you will need
      3. Prioritize them
      4. Use CRC cards and digital prototype to build the first vertical slide of your game
      5. Get started building in Unity
      6. Turn in your build
      7. Get Peer Review
4. Week 4: Agile Development
   1. Backlog, Sprint Plan, Burn-down Chart
5. Week 5: Writing Better Code + Game Build
   1. Refactoring Plan
   2. Game Build 1 for Play-testing
      1. Upload Game Demo
      2. Get Peer Feedback
6. Week 6 & 7: Play-testing + Game Build Iteratively
   1. Implement Unity Analytics to measure key game metrics
7. Week 8: Release The Game + Final Game
   1. Fix any bugs
   2. Make, test and save your final buiild
   3. Upload and release your game
   4. Make a trailer
   5. Postmortem

## Self-Assessment

1. How are your skills right now with Unity?
2. What kind of game you can build realistically?
3. What Unity skills do you still need to learn?
4. Who can you connect with to get feedback on your game?
